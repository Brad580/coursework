**Unit Tests:**

1. **Multiplication Function:**
   - Expect multiplication(2, 3) to be a number.
   - Expect multiplication(2, 3) to be equal to 6.
   - Expect multiplication(0, 5) to be equal to 0.
   - Expect multiplication(-2, 4) to be equal to -8.
   - Expect multiplication("a", 3) to be an error.
   - Expect multiplication(2, "b") to be an error.
   - Expect multiplication(null, 3) to be an error.

2. **ConcatOdds Function:**
   - Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be an array.
   - Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be equal to [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15].
   - Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5]) to be equal to [1, 3, 5].
   - Expect concatOdds([], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be equal to [-1, 1, 9, 15].
   - Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], []) to be equal to [1, 3].
   - Expect concatOdds(["a", 2, 4], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be an error.
   - Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [true, false, 15, -1]) to be an error.
   - Expect concatOdds(null, [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be an error.

**Functional Tests:**

3. **Shopping Cart Checkout Feature:**
   - When the cart is empty and the user tries to check out, they won't be notified that the cart is empty.
   - When a user checks out as a guest, they'll be prompted to create an account or log in.
   - When a user checks out as a logged-in user, they should proceed to the next step without additional authentication.
   - When a user creates an account during checkout, they should be successfully logged in afterward.
   - When a user logs in during checkout, they should proceed to the next step seamlessly.
   - At each step of checkout, the user should be shown a summary of their order and the total cost.
   - If the user abandons the checkout process, their cart should still contain the items upon returning.
   - If the user encounters an error during checkout, they should be notified appropriately.
   - If the user decides to go back during checkout, they should return to the previous step with the entered information retained.
   - If the user completes the checkout successfully, they should receive an order confirmation.

Remember to adjust the specifics based on the actual functionalities and requirements of the code or application you are testing.
